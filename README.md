# Space-Ace-Game
Just a little space shoot-'em-up I made for a game design course

You can run it by downloading lime and haxe flixel and running the
command "lime test neko" in the source directory or by running the
.exe located in export/bin/GameProject1.exe

Controls:


Mouse - aim

Left mouse click - fire



Hope you enjoy!
